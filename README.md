# <Professional Portfolio>

## Description

As a budding developer, I wanted to show off my skills and previous projects with a portfolio. 

Over the course of this project, I implemented what I learned about HTML and CSS by building both from scratch, element and class selectors in CSS and their semantics, web design, to make it more appealing to the eye, and making it as interactive as made sense. 

With his portfolio, I can start the process of self marketing and have a way to keep track of my previous projects and works outside of GitHub.

This will be an ongoing project, so be sure to check back for more updates and design changes.
